    I worked as the front-end developer initially, and used the open source Scratch project by MIT for developing the required application. Later I was assigned to work in the backend pipeline, which converts the tutorial videos into an output file supported by Scratch. The primary goal of the project was to teach coding concepts to kids, in an interactive manner.
